## Description 
[The Deployed Site.](https://fa-texteditor.herokuapp.com/).

This text editor is a PWA aaplication that, retrieves data from, and stores data to an IndexedDB. 

Some code from an exisiting application was provided. However, I added scripts to the package.json, implmented asset caching to the src-sw.js, and additinal code to the src/js files.

## Portfolio Example

An integral component of creating this application was including scripts in the package.json. Doing so allows for specific actions to be called upon. For example, "start:dev" will start both the client and server folders at the same time, whereas "start" will run and build only the server.

```
  "scripts": {
    "start:dev": """,
    "start": """,
    "server": """,
    "build": """,
    "install": """,
    "client": """
  },

```

These are the scripts I added.

```
  "scripts": {
    "start:dev": "concurrently \"cd server && npm run server\" \"cd client && npm run dev\"",
    "start": "npm run build && cd server && node server.js",
    "server": "cd server nodemon server.js --ignore client",
    "build": "cd client && npm run build",
    "install": "cd server && npm i && cd ../client && npm i",
    "client": "cd client && npm start"
  },

```


## Usage 

Use Insomnia to view and interact with information using the routes.


## Learning Points 

Adding the scripts to the package.json helped me to reflect on the commands I run through the terminal.
